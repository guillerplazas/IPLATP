### Abstract

> The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced a new approach for guiding Interactive Theorem Provers (ITPs)—tools originally designed to help users construct formal proofs. This project explores the potential of integrating LLMs with ITPs to address high school inequality problems. By examining LLMs’ ability to complete formal proofs through different feedback models, this study benchmarks GPT-4o against POLYA. Through iterative feedback mechanisms, the project demonstrates how domain-specific knowledge and systematic error correction can enhance the reliability and performance of LLMs in formal proof generation. This research, conducted at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, contributes to understanding how these technologies complement one another to enable automated theorem proving.
